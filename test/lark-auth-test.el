;;; Commentary:

;; ERT tests for lark.el's auth helpers — currently focused on the
;; device-code polling success detector, which previously missed
;; completion when the CLI's response shape didn't include `ok: t'.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'cl-lib)

;; Add project directories to load-path.

  (dolist (sub '("." "core" "ui" "domain" "ai"))
