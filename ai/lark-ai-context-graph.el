;;; Commentary:

;; The substrate for "connect the dots" workflows: given a TOPIC string,
;; fan out to every registered provider (one per Lark domain), collect
;; their results concurrently, and hand a single markdown blob back to
;; the caller for LLM synthesis.
;;
;; v1 ships with two providers — Docs (`lark-cli docs +search') and
;; Messages (`lark-cli im +messages-search') — but the registry
;; (`lark-ai-context-graph-providers') is open: any function with
;; signature (TOPIC BUDGET DONE-FN) can be added, and the gatherer
;; will divide the budget proportionally and stitch the section into
;; the output in registration order.
;;
;; The gatherer never errors out a brief because of one bad provider:
;; a failing CLI call is logged and silently contributes nothing.
;; That lets new providers be experimental without breaking the rest.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'lark-core)

;; Resolved at call time; lives in `lark-ai.el'.

  "Soft upper bound (chars) for the gathered context across all providers.
Divided proportionally across enabled providers; each provider may
clip its own section to stay under its share.  Set higher to feed
the LLM more material at the cost of slower synthesis and more
tokens; set lower to keep briefs lean."

work with on each match."

Each PROVIDER-FN has signature (TOPIC BUDGET DONE-FN):
- TOPIC    — the user-supplied search string
- BUDGET   — soft chars cap for this provider's section
- DONE-FN  — invoked exactly once with the formatted markdown text,
             or nil to skip the section entirely.

Order is preserved in the rendered brief.  Add new providers by
`add-to-list' or `setq' — providers that error out are skipped
silently so experimental additions can't break the workflow.")
